# Class overview
So, we had our very first class took place today. We discussed about what an online judge is and how does a problem statement look like.

**Please visit following online judges and grasp some ideas before the next class! :)**
- [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com "Codeforces")
- [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/ "Codechef")
- [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/ "AtCoder")
- [URI OJ](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/ "URI OJ")
- [vjudge](https://vjudge.net/ "vjudge") (It is not actually a real online judge btw)

Problem(s) we checked in our first class:
- [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A "https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A")

Very basic problemset for practice for newbies. I am suggesting everyone to complete as much problem as you can from this list:
- URI OJ: [https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en/problems/index/1](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en/problems/index/1 "https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en/problems/index/1")

For those who want to sharpen their basic coding skills, are requested to go through one of these materials (basically whichever you prefer):
- [https://www.eshikkha.net/](https://www.eshikkha.net/ "https://www.eshikkha.net/")
- [http://cpbook.subeen.com/](http://cpbook.subeen.com/ "http://cpbook.subeen.com/")

One more important thing.
I have provided almost `evreything` for a person in order to start their journey in programming. You just need to EXPLORE everything from possible places. Smart people always do find their own paths and this is the best way to achieve success.
Yeah, you can always take help but you need to evaluate yourself too!

Cheers!
